# upload-encrypted-artifact (Action)

This action creates an encrypted artifact.

This action archives the provided paths into a file named `archive.tar`, encrypts it producing `archive.tar.age`, and uploads the encrypted file as an artifact.
- Encryption tool: age (https://age-encryption.org)
- Mode: recipient public key (X25519)

Important:
- Provide an age recipient public key (age1...) via the `recipient` input.
- Use the matching `download-encrypted-artifact` action with the corresponding private identity key to decrypt and extract.
