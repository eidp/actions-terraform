# upload-encrypted-artifact (Action)

This action creates an encrypted artifact.

This action archives the provided paths into a file named `archive.tar`, encrypts it producing `archive.tar.bin`, and uploads the encrypted file as an artifact.
- Cipher: OpenSSL symmetric cipher (default: aes-256-cbc)
- KDF: pbkdf2 with salt (OpenSSL default for `-pbkdf2 -salt`)

Important:
- Do NOT echo the passphrase (key). Keep it only in GitHub secrets.
- Use the matching `download-encrypted-artifact` action to download, decrypt, and extract (untar) the archive in consumer workflows.
